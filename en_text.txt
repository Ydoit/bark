All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. 
Sometimes it was as long as a year; sometimes as short as twenty four hours. 
But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed man chose to spend his last days or his last hours. 
I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited.
Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should do under similar circumstances. 
What events, what experiences, what associations should we crowd into those last hours as mortal beings? 
What happiness should we find in reviewing the past, what regrets?
Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. 
Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. 
We should live each day with a gentleness, a vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost 
when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. 
There are those, of course, who would adopt the epicurean motto of “Eat, drink, and be merry,” 
but most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death.
Most of us take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in the future.
When we are in buoyant health, death is all but unimaginable. 
We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. 
So we go about our petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.
The same lethargy, I am afraid, characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses. 
Only the deaf appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight. 
Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life. 
But those who have never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties. 
Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily, without concentration, and with little appreciation. 
It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not being conscious of health until we are ill.
I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. 
Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.
Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see.
Recently I was visited by a very good friend why had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed. 
“Nothing in particular,” she replied. 
I might have been incredulous had I not been acustomed to such responses, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.
How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note? 
I who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. 
I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough shaggy bark of a pine. 
In spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening Nature after her winter’s sleep. 
I feel the delightful, velvety texture of a flower, and discover its remarkable convolutions; 
and something of the miracle of Nature is revealed to me. 
Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song. 
I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook rush through my open fingers. 
To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug. 
To me the pageant of seasons is a thrilling and unending drama, the action of which streams through my finger tips. 
At times my heart cries out with longing to see all these things. 
If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. 
Yet, those who have eyes apparently see little. The panorama of color and action which fills the world is taken for granted. 
It is human, perhaps, to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have not, 
but it is a great pity that in the world of light the gift of sight is used only as a mere convenience rather than as a means of adding fullness to life. 
Oh, the things that I should see if I had the power of sight for three days.
Once upon a time, deep in the heart of an ancient woodland, there stood an enchanted forest where magic flowed through every leaf and twig. 
The trees were so tall that their branches seemed to caress the very clouds, and the undergrowth was a vibrant tapestry of ferns, mosses, and wildflowers in every hue imaginable.
At the center of this verdant wonderland lay a crystalline lake, its waters so pure and pristine that it perfectly mirrored the azure sky above. 
Willows trailed their whispering tendrils into the shimmering depths, creating a tranquil sanctuary for all manner of woodland creatures.
It was here, in a sunlit clearing beside the lake, that a young faun named Llyr made his home. 
Llyr was a curious and adventurous soul, his hooves often leading him off the beaten path to explore the forest's most secluded groves and glades. 
He could commune with the ancient trees and converse with the very spirits of the woods.
One golden afternoon, as Llyr was bathing in the cool waters of the lake, he spotted a human child wandering among the ferns, hopelessly lost. 
The faun's heart went out to the bewildered little one, and he emerged from the lake to guide her back to safety.
"Do not fear, young one," said Llyr in his gentle voice. "I shall lead you out of this forest before nightfall."
The child, whose name was Emily, gazed up at Llyr with eyes wide in amazement. 
"You can talk!" she exclaimed. "And what manner of creature are you?"
Llyr chuckled warmly. "I am a faun, a guardian of this ancient wood. And this is no ordinary forest, little one. It is the Enchanted Forest, a realm of magic and wonder."
As Llyr led Emily along the winding forest paths, he regaled her with tales of the dryads, sprites, and other fabled beings who made their home among the whispering trees. 
Emily listened with rapt attention, her childlike sense of awe and curiosity rekindled by the faun's words.
Before long, Emily grew weary, and Llyr bade her to climb upon his sturdy back. 
As the faun cantered nimbly through the shadowed glades, 
Emily was entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors and shapes that whirled past – towering deciduous giants, babbling brooks, and fleeting glimpses of pale woodland spirits flitting between the trunks.
At length, they came to the forest's edge, where the trees thinned and gave way to the open meadows beyond. 
It was there that Emily's family stood waiting, their faces etched with relief and joy at her return.
As Emily waved farewell to her newfound friend, Llyr spoke once more: "Remember me, Emily, for this forest shall always welcome you. 
The magic lives on as long as there are those with open hearts, minds, and eyes to dream..."
With those parting words, the noble faun turned and melted back into the emerald embrace of the Enchanted Forest, leaving Emily to wonder if her wondrous experience had been nothing more than a beautiful dream.
The ancient isle of Avalon had long been shrouded in mystery, its standing stones and lush valleys said to be the domain of priestesses imbued with powerful magic. 
It was here that the great Merlin himself had once walked, learning the old ways under the tutelage of the all-knowing Lady of the Lake.
For centuries, a lineage of priestesses had ministered to the sacred groves and lakes of Avalon, serving as guardians of the ancient knowledge and rituals. 
Their gifts were extraordinary - some could glimpse the future in the ripples of the still pools, while others could harness the very forces of nature through prayer and meditation.
But as the modern world encroached upon the isolated island, the old ways began to fade into legend. 
The lineage was broken, the sacred sites neglected, and it seemed that Avalon's magic would be extinguished forever.
Until the day young Elara was born, her arrival heralded by a miraculous shower of rose petals that seemed to fall from the very sky itself.
Raised by her doting but troubled mother, Elara showed an affinity for the old powers from a tender age. 
She could coax seeds into bloom with a whispered word, and animals were instinctively drawn to her gentle presence. 
On her sixth birthday, with no instruction, she wove an endless crown of wildflowers that refused to wilt or fade.
As she grew older, strange dreams and visions began to haunt her sleep – echoes of ancient voices and half-forgotten prophecies that hinted at a great destiny. 
Try as she might to follow a conventional path, the lure of Avalon's wild places proved irresistible.
It was on one such sojourn among the standing stones that Elara experienced her awakening. 
As she laid her hands upon the ancient  lichened monoliths, an electric force seemed to surge through her very being. 
The spirit world parted its veil to her inner eye, revealing its myriad inhabitants in their ephemeral splendor.
In that moment, Elara's true calling became clear. 
She was the Last Priestess of Avalon, fated to rekindle the island's slumbering magic and restore its sacred sites to their former glory.
Elara's journey was fraught with challenges - there were those who branded her a charlatan, or worse, a witch. 
Tales of her miraculous gifts inspired both awe and mistrust among the islanders. 
But her unwavering faith in the old ways sustained her through even the darkest trials.
Slowly but surely, Avalon's spiritual heart began to stir once more under Elara's careful tending. 
The groves were retamed, ancient shrines rededicated, and the old rituals reinstated to honor the cyclic turn of the seasons.
As the years rolled by, seekers and pilgrims were drawn to Avalon from far and wide, hoping to bask in its rejuvenated  mystical energies. 
And at the center of this renaissance stood the serene figure of Elara, the age-old power flowing through her like a conduit as she initiated new priestesses to guard the ancient isle.
For Elara knew that the magic of Avalon would never truly fade, so long as there remained a sacred communion between its priestesses and the eternal well of nature's bountiful spirit. 
The old ways would flow eternal, like the turn of the seasons and the cycles of the moon and stars themselves.
The old lighthouse keeper had been tending the lamp for over 50 years, guiding countless ships safely through the treacherous rocks just offshore. 
His life's purpose was as unwavering as the beam from the great lantern room high above the crashing waves. 
One fateful night, a brutal storm rolled in, and a small fishing vessel foundered on the deadly stones in the darkness. 
The keeper sprang into action, launching the lifeboats and braving the tempest to rescue the floundering crew. 
Though the waves battered him relentlessly, he would not rest until the last soul was pulled from the roiling sea. 
As dawn's light crept across the tumultuous waters, the battered fishermen looked upon their savior with awe and gratitude, for the keeper's courage had once more shone like a beacon in the night.
